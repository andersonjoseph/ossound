# Ossound

This is a simple REST API that provides some basic CRUD operations for audio hosting (inspired on soundgasm)

## Installation
To install the dependencies, run:

```
pnpm install
```

To start the server, run:

```
pnpm dev
```

The server will listen on port 8080 by default. You can change the port by setting the PORT environment variable in `/docker-compose.yml`

## Testing
```
pnpm t
```
